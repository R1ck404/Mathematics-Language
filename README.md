```

Defining values
```swift
# You can define variables by simply doing the following,
# Type 'var' and after it your variable name. then by using 'is' you can set it's value.

var test is 69
var defined_value is 0
```

Redefining variables.
```swift
# You can redifine variables by simply doing the following,
# Call the variable name and use 'is' to set its new value.

test is 21
defined_value is 1
```

Printing variables
```ANTLR
# You can print variables by doing 'print <YOUR_VARIABLE>'

print defined_value
print test
```
